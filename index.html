        <div class="about-me__body">
            Currently, I am an MSc cyber security student at Manchester Metropolitan University. My mission is to reinforce my abilities, techniques and what I am learning to defend organizations from state actors and cyber-criminals.
            In my journey so far, I have learned how to apply the level of rigor that is need to apply to each asset based on the business goals and criticality of that asset and the balance of confidentiality, integrity and availability. I have previously used Purdue model and zones and conduits in order to break down the industrial control systems and know where the security lies and how we can apply security in different ways. I have implemented the main stage of a digital forensicsâ€™ investigation with preserving ACPO principles in order to extract the data form a computer with minimising my impact on actual data. 
         I have developed a modern cryptosystems software using Python. I have used Cisco Packet Tracer to practice network simulation and troubleshooting skills, create a network (devices, routers, switches) and see how it works and how data packets move from one device to another, setting up device racks and selecting the right cables and ports. I have used Wireshark to investigate packets in operation (HTTP, TCP, IP, Ethernet).
            In addition, this semester I am developing new skills in order to broaden my knowledge in information security management, network security, secure software life-cycle, web application security and penetration testing.
            
            My goal will be focusing on designing a system with security in mind and Architect it, so it is easily defendable and ensure that it is capable of producing the right security logging data and secure the system has the required level of resilience in the event of attacks.</div>
